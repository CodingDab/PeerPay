# PeerPay
The beginnings of a cryptocurrency that differs greatly from those based on BitCoin and BitCoin itself. PeerPay focuses on the necessity of exchanging money between individuals. The value of PeerCoin is fixed in that it is set not on what people will pay for it since it is not 'legal' to exchange it with other monetary units. Instead, PeerCoin's value comes from the concept of potential for work, where what you pay for is work that was done (just like in the real world). Therefore, when a new wallet opens up, new PeerCoins enter the economy for taking, so that the PeerPay economy grows with a population. PeerPay wallets store balance and other information so that it is much more manageable over time and so that people can store their PeerCoin on their own machines.
